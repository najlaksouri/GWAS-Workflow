# Phenotypic traits evaluation

In this study, we used a discovery panel of 90 peach accessions in order to dissect the genetic architecture of 16 fruit-related traits:
- harvest date (HvD; Julian days)
- fruit weight (FW; grams)
- flesh firmness (FF; Newton)
- soluble solids content (SSC; °Brix)
- titratable acidity (TA; grams malic acid/100 g flesh weight)
-  ripening index (RI; SSC/TA)
-  vitamin C (Vit C; mg of ascorbic acid/100 g flesh weight)
-  total phenolics (Phen; mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g flesh weight)
-  contents of flavonoid (Flv; catechin equivalents/100 g flesh weight)
-  anthocyanin (ACNs; cyanidin-3-glucoside/kg flesh weight)
-  sucrose (Suc; g/kg flesh weight)
-  glucose (Glu; g/kg flesh weight)
-  fructose (Fruc; g/kg flesh weight)
-  sorbitol (SRB; g/kg flesh weight)
-  total sugars (TS; g/kg flesh weight)
-  relative antioxidant capacity (RAC; μg TE/g flesh weight)

Only traits with **H<sup>2</sup>  > 0.5** were considered for association analysis. Consequently, contents of glucose, fructose, sucrose and total sugars were discarded from the subsequent analysis.


## Marker-trait associations 
For association mapping, seven statistical models, ranging from single to multi-locus, were simultaneously tested in GAPIT v3.1.065:
- General linear model (GLM)
- Mixed linear model (MLM)
- Compressed MLM (CMLM)
- Settlement of MLMs under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER).
- Multiple loci mixed linear model (MLMM)
- Fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU)
- Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK)
